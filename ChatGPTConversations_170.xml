You just need to pass an array of group IDs as the first parameter.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```php\n&lt;?php\n// Check if the user belongs to any of the specified groups on the current site\n$groupIds = array(1, 2, 3); // IDs of the groups to check\nif (CSite::InGroup($groupIds, SITE_ID))\n{\n   echo \&quot;You are a member of one of the specified groups!\&quot;;\n}\n?&gt;\n```\n\nIn the above code, we pass an array of three group IDs (`1`, `2`, and `3`) to the `InGroup` method. If the currently logged-in user is a member of any of those groups on the current site, the condition will be true, and the message will be displayed.&quot;}],&quot;clientCode&quot;:&quot;CHAT_COMPLETION&quot;,&quot;model&quot;:&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,&quot;createdOn&quot;:[2023,4,3,17,52,0,499241000],&quot;updatedOn&quot;:[2023,4,3,17,52,59,785968000]}]}}" />
